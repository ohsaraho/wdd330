        <h3>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja <br> Chapter 9: The Window Object</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In every JavaScript environment it has a <strong>global object</strong>. Any variables that are created in the global scope are properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it. <br>In the browser environment the global object is the <strong>window</strong> object, which represents the browser windo that contains a web page.</li>
            <li>There is no official standard for the Browser Object Model (BOM), there are a number of properties and methods that are supported by all the major browsers, making a sort of de facto (no official) standard. <br>These properties and methods are available through the window object which every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.</li>
            <li>JavaScript can be run in different environments but the BOM makes sense in a browser environment which means that other environments (like Node.js) probably won't have a window object, although they will still have a global object; for example, Node.js has an object called global.<br>If you don't know or remember the name of the global object, you can also refer to it using the keyword <strong>this</strong> in the global scope.<br>The example below shows how to assign the variable <strong>global</strong> to the global object:<br><br>// from within the global scope<br>
                const global = this;</li>
            <li>Going Global: which are variables that are created without using the const, let, or var keywords and global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program.<br>Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser environment, the global object is the window object which means that any global variable created is actually a property of the <strong>window</strong> object, shown in the following example:<br><br>x = 6;  // global variable created<br>
                << 6<br><br>
                
                window.x // same variable can be accessed as a property of the window object<br>
                << 6<br><br>
                
                // both variables are exactly the same<br>
                window.x === x;<br>
                << true</li>
            <li>You should refer global variables without using the window object which means less typing and your code will be more portable between environments. <br>You use an exception if you need to check whether a global variable has been defined.<br>For example, the code below will throw a ReferenceError if x has not been defined:<br><br>if (x) {<br>// do something<br><br>If the variable is accessed as a property of the window object, then it will still work as window.x and will return false, meaning the block of code will not be evaluated<br><br>if (window.x) {<br>
                // do something<br>
                }</li>
            <li>Some functions like <strong>parseInt()</strong> and <strong>isNaN()</strong> are actually methods of the global object, which within a browser environment it makes them methods of the window object:<br><br>window.parseInt(4.2);
                << 4<br><br>
                
                window.isNaN(4.2);
                << false<br>Like variables, it is customary to omit accessing them through the window object.<br>ES6 made parseInt() and isNaN() methods of the Number object, which means that they both can be called using the following code:<br><br>Number.parseInt(4.2);
                << 4<br><br>
                
                Number.isNaN(4.2);
                << false<br></li>
            <li>The three functions mentioned in chapter 1 that produce dialogs in the browser such as: <strong>alert()</strong>, <strong>confirm()</strong> and <strong>prompt()</strong>; are not part of the ECMAScript standard, even though the major browsers support them as methods of the window object.</li>
            <li>The <strong>window.alert()</strong> method pauses the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box. The message is the argument to the method, and undefined is always returnd:<br><br> window.alert('Hello');
                << undefined<br></li>
            <li>The <strong>window.confirm()</strong> method stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation in a dialog box which shows the message provided as the argument and gives the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean values of true, if the user clicks OK and false if the user clicks Cancel:<br><br>window.confirm('Do you wish to continue?');<
                << undefined<br><li>
            <li>The <strong>window.prompt()</strong> method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message that is provided as an argument, as well as an input field that lets the user to enter text. The text is returned as a string when the user clicks OK but if the user clicks Cancel, null is returned: <br><br>window.prompt('Please enter your name:');<br></li>
            <li>These methods will stop the execution of a program in its track which means that everything will stop processing when the method is called, until the user clicks OK or Cancel.</li>
