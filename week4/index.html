        <h3>Javascript: Novice to Ninja <br> Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Forms "<form>" element contains form controls like input fields, select menus, and buttons. The input fields can be filled out with information that is processed once the form has been submitted.</li>
            <li>Traditionally, after the forms had been submitted, it would then be sent to a server were the information would be processed by using a backend language like PHP or Ruby. But it is becoming more and more common, to process the information that is in a form on the frontend before it would be sent to the server by using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The legacy DOM had a useful property called <strong>document.forms</strong> which returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order that they appear in the markup. Even if there is only one form, a collection will still be returned which we have to use an index notation to return the first form object. For exmaple: <br>const form = document.forms[0]; <br> Or like this: <br> const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];</li>
            <li>We could also use the "name" attribute to identify a form instead of using a numerical index, like so: <br> const form = document.forms.search; <br> But you must be careful referencing elements this way since if the form had the same name any properties or methods of the document.forms object, like "submit", that property or method would be referenced instead of the form element.</li>
            <li>To avaoid the same names, the <strong>square bracket notation</strong> can be used. Which is required if the form's name attribute contains any invalid characters, like spaces or dashes. For example: <br>const form = document.forms['search'];</li>
            <li>The form object also has a method called <strong>elements</strong> which returns an HTML collection of all the elements that are contained in the form. For example: <br>const [input,button] = form.elements; (which contains two controls an input element and a button element.)</li>
            <li>You can also access the form controls by using the "name" attribute but it also is suggested to use the square bracket notation when using the name attribute. For example: <br>const input = form['searchInput']</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Javascript: Novice to Ninja <br> Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In JavaScript an <strong>object</strong> is a self-contained set of related values and function. The act as a collection that is of named propertes mapped to any JavaScript value like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and functions. <br> It is called a <strong>method</strong> if the property's value is a function.</li>
            <li>An object is like a dictionary where you can look up a property name and then see a value.</li>
            <li>Objects are usually used when wanting to keep related information and functionality in the same place together.</li>
            <li>An <strong>object literal</strong> is an object that is created by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces {} <br> All objects can be changable at any time when the program is running which means that its properties and methods can be removed or changed and then if wanted new properties can be added to the object even if it was declard using a "const".</li>
            <li>You can create an object literal like this: const spiderman = {};</li>
            <li>You access the properties of an object by using the dot notation. Like so: superman.name <br> Outputs:
                << 'Superman'<br> You can also access it by using bracket notation. Like so: superman['name'] <br> Outputs:
                << 'Superman'</li>
            <li>The dot notation is the most common way but the bracket notation does have a few advantages: like it is the only way to access nonstandard property and method names that aren't following the variable nameing rules. As well as it lets you evaluate an expression and use it as the property key. For example: <br> superman["real" + " " + "name"] // the property is built using string concatenation <br>
                << "Clark Kent" <br> If you try to access a property that doesn't exist though, undefined will be returned. For example: <br> superman.city <br>
                << undefined</li>
            <li>When <strong>Calling Methods</strong> we also can use dot or bracket notation. Calling a method is the same when we invoke a function so parentheses need to be placed after the method name. For example: <br> superman.fly()<br><< 'Up, up and away!'<br>superman['fly']()<br><< 'Up, up and away!'</li>
        </ul>
