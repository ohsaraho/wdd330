        <h3>Javascript: Novice to Ninja <br> Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Forms "<form>" element contains form controls like input fields, select menus, and buttons. The input fields can be filled out with information that is processed once the form has been submitted.</li>
            <li>Traditionally, after the forms had been submitted, it would then be sent to a server were the information would be processed by using a backend language like PHP or Ruby. But it is becoming more and more common, to process the information that is in a form on the frontend before it would be sent to the server by using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The legacy DOM had a useful property called <strong>document.forms</strong> which returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order that they appear in the markup. Even if there is only one form, a collection will still be returned which we have to use an index notation to return the first form object. For exmaple: <br>const form = document.forms[0]; <br> Or like this: <br> const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];</li>
            <li>We could also use the "name" attribute to identify a form instead of using a numerical index, like so: <br> const form = document.forms.search; <br> But you must be careful referencing elements this way since if the form had the same name any properties or methods of the document.forms object, like "submit", that property or method would be referenced instead of the form element.</li>
            <li>To avaoid the same names, the <strong>square bracket notation</strong> can be used. Which is required if the form's name attribute contains any invalid characters, like spaces or dashes. For example: <br>const form = document.forms['search'];</li>
            <li>The form object also has a method called <strong>elements</strong> which returns an HTML collection of all the elements that are contained in the form. For example: <br>const [input,button] = form.elements; (which contains two controls an input element and a button element.)</li>
            <li>You can also access the form controls by using the "name" attribute but it also is suggested to use the square bracket notation when using the name attribute. For example: <br>const input = form['searchInput']</li>
            <li>Form objects have many useful properties and methods to interact with with the form.</li>
            <li>The <strong>form.submit()</strong> method, submits the form automatically. But it will not trigger the form submit event which is covered later in the next section.</li>
            <li>The form can also be submitted manually by the user by clicking a button or input element with the type attribute of submit or an input element with a type attribute of image.</li>
            <li>The <strong>form.reset()</strong> method resets all the form controls back to their intitial values that were specified in the HTML.</li>
            <li>Also, a button that has the type attribute of reset can be used to reset the form without the need for additional scripting. But reset buttons are poor to use for usability since it is easy to click a button and then have all the users data that was typed in lost.</li>
            <li>The <strong>form.action</strong> property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so that it would be sent to a different URL to be processed on the server. Written like this: <br>form.action = '/an/other.url'</li>
            <li>The <strong>focus</strong> event happens when an element is focused on. When dealing with an input element this is when the cursor is placed inside the element. By either clicking or tapping or possibly navigating to it using the keyboard</li>
