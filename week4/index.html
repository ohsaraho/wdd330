        <h3>Javascript: Novice to Ninja <br> Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Forms "<form>" element contains form controls like input fields, select menus, and buttons. The input fields can be filled out with information that is processed once the form has been submitted.</li>
            <li>Traditionally, after the forms had been submitted, it would then be sent to a server were the information would be processed by using a backend language like PHP or Ruby. But it is becoming more and more common, to process the information that is in a form on the frontend before it would be sent to the server by using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The legacy DOM had a useful property called <strong>document.forms</strong> which returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order that they appear in the markup. Even if there is only one form, a collection will still be returned which we have to use an index notation to return the first form object. For exmaple: <br>const form = document.forms[0]; <br> Or like this: <br> const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];</li>
            <li>We could also use the "name" attribute to identify a form instead of using a numerical index, like so: <br> const form = document.forms.search; <br> But you must be careful referencing elements this way since if the form had the same name any properties or methods of the document.forms object, like "submit", that property or method would be referenced instead of the form element.</li>
            <li>To avaoid the same names, the <strong>square bracket notation</strong> can be used. Which is required if the form's name attribute contains any invalid characters, like spaces or dashes. For example: <br>const form = document.forms['search'];</li>
            <li>The form object also has a method called <strong>elements</strong> which returns an HTML collection of all the elements that are contained in the form. For example: <br>const [input,button] = form.elements; (which contains two controls an input element and a button element.)</li>
            <li>You can also access the form controls by using the "name" attribute but it also is suggested to use the square bracket notation when using the name attribute. For example: <br>const input = form['searchInput']</li>
            <li>Form objects have many useful properties and methods to interact with with the form.</li>
            <li>The <strong>form.submit()</strong> method, submits the form automatically. But it will not trigger the form submit event which is covered later in the next section.</li>
            <li>The form can also be submitted manually by the user by clicking a button or input element with the type attribute of submit or an input element with a type attribute of image.</li>
            <li>The <strong>form.reset()</strong> method resets all the form controls back to their intitial values that were specified in the HTML.</li>
            <li>Also, a button that has the type attribute of reset can be used to reset the form without the need for additional scripting. But reset buttons are poor to use for usability since it is easy to click a button and then have all the users data that was typed in lost.</li>
            <li>The <strong>form.action</strong> property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so that it would be sent to a different URL to be processed on the server. Written like this: <br>form.action = '/an/other.url'</li>
            <li>The <strong>focus</strong> event happens when an element is focused on. When dealing with an input element this is when the cursor is placed inside the element. By either clicking or tapping or possibly navigating to it using the keyboard. <br>For exmaple: <br>const input = form.elements.searchInput;<br> input.addEventListener('focus', () => alert('focused'), false);</li>
            <li>The <strong>blur</strong> event happens when the user moves the focus away from the form element. For example: <br>input.addEventListener('blur', () => alert('blurred'), false);</li>
            <li>The <strong>change</strong> event happens when the user moves the focus away from the form element but after changing it. Which means if the user clicks in an input field but makes no changes and then clicks some where else, the change event won't activate, but the blur event will. <br>For example: <br>input.addEventListener('change', () => alert('changed'), false);</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Javascript: Novice to Ninja <br> Chapter 15: Modern JavaScript Development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>module</strong> is a self-contained piece of code that has functions and methods, that then can be used in other files and also by other modules. Which helps keep code more organized in separate, reuseable files that improves code maintainability.</li>
            <li>Code in a module should have a single purpose and group together funcitons that have distinct functinoality. For example, the module could include functions that are used for Ajax, that then can be used in any project where Ajax is required.</li>
            <li>Having code in modular helps to make it more loosely coupled and interchangeable, which means that you can easily swap one module for another without affecting other parts in a project.</li>
            <li>Also, modules allow a public API to be exposed, when the implementation is hidden away within the module.</li>
            <li><strong>Coupling of code</strong> refers to how certain element or modules of code are dependent upon each other. Which two pieces of code are referred to be tightly coupled if one depends on the other to run. This happends if a piece of code makes hard-coded reference another piece of code, that is needed to be used.</li>
            <li>Here are some important points about modules that are good to keep in your mind:</li>
            <li>All code that is in modules is always in strict "mode" even without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to not be in strict mode.</li>
            <li>Modules have there own global scope, which means any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be aceesed in that module.</li>
            <li>The value of <strong>this</strong> within the top level of a module is <strong>undefined</strong>, rather than the global object.</li>
            <li>You also can't use HTML-style comment within modules (but this isn't very common these days in any JavaScript program).</li>
        </ul>
