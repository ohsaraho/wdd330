        <h1>Week 2</h1>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h2>Javascript: Novice to Ninja <br> Chapter 2: Programming Basics, Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops, and Chapter 4: Functions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI) is used by JavaScript interpreters which places semicolons at the end of each line for you. <br> Although that can cause errors, so it's best to put a semi-colon and each statement on a new line.</li>
            <li>Blocks which is a series of statements within curly brackets do not need to be terminated by a semicolon.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Variables must be declared before they can be used.</li>
            <li>JavaScript keywords to declare variables are: <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong></li>
            <li><strong>const</strong> is used when the variable will not be changed to another value.</li>
            <li><strong>let</strong> is used if the variable might change later in the program.</li>
            <li>The "=" operator is used to assign a value to a variable or constant (const)</li>
            <li>When using "const" you can't reassign the value if it is primitive data type like a string <br> but if it is a non-primitive data type like an object then it can change <br> This is known as mutating the object. For example: <br> const name = { value: 'Sam' }; <br> name.value = 'Heather';</li>
            <li>const can not be reassigned to another object though. For example: <br> const name = { value: 'Sam' }; <br> Tried to reassign another object <br> name = { value: 'Heather' }; <br> It can't be changed.</li>
            <li>Using <strong>const</strong> helps with making your program more predictable because the value can't change. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>const and let are block scoped which means their value only exist within the block they were declared in.</li>
            <li>"var" worked alot like how "let" works but "var" does not have block scope.</li>
            <li><strong>global scope</strong> is any variable that is declared outside of a block which it means it can be accessible in the whole entire program. <br> This is not best practice because you can run into the same name with another global variable and could overwrite each other's values.</li>
            <li>local scope are created within blocks. <br> Which means any variable declared inside that block is only accessible within that block</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Template Literals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Template Literals</strong> are special types of strings</li>
            <li>They use the backtick character <strong>` `</strong>. For example: `Hello world!`;</li>
            <li>An expression can be within the template literal and the value will be displayed. This is called interpolation. For example: <br> const name = `Sam`; <br> `Hello <strong>${</strong>name<strong>}</strong>!` <br> Output: 'Hello Sam!'</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Converting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The best way to <strong>convert strings to numbers</strong> is by using the <strong>Number(' ');</strong> function. <br> If the string can't be converted into a number then "NaN" is returned as a result.</li>
            <li>You can also multiply a numerical string by 1 which will convert into a number. This is called type coercion.</li>
            <li>Another way is to put the plus sign "+" operator in front of the numerical string. For example: <br> const answer = +'5';</li>
            <li>The best way to <strong>convert numbers to strings</strong> is by using the <strong>String(' '); function.</strong>
            <li>You can also add an empty string which is type coercion. For example: <br> 3 +''; Returns: '3'</li>
            <li>Another option is the <strong>toString()</strong> method. For example: <br> 10..toString(); Returns: '10'</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Parsing Numbers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>parseInt() can also be used to convert a string that is a (representaion) of a numerical value back into a number. For example: <br> parseInt('1010,2'); the result is: 10. Or parseInt('omg, 36'); the result is: 31912. parseInt('23',10); the result is: 23.</li>
            <li>If the parseInt function starts with a number, it will ignore any letters that are after the numbers.</li>
            <li>Also, if you use parseInt with decimal, it will remove anything that is after the decimal point.</li>
            <li>parseFloat converts a string that has a number and a decimal point and converts into a floating point decimal number. For exmaple: <br> parseFloat('2.9',10); the result is: 2.9.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Array Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An array is a typeof 'object' and is an ordered list of values. You can create an array either an <strong>array literal</strong> like "const myArray = [];" or an <strong>array constructor</strong> function like "const myArray = new Array();". <br> but the best way to create an area is an <strong>array literal</strong></li>
            <li>To remove the last item of an array, you can use the <strong>pop()</strong> method. For example: nameOfArray.pop(); It returns the last item of that array but it is no longer includes that item.</li>
            <li>To remove the first item of an array, you can use the <strong>shift()</strong> method. It works in a similar way as the pop() method.</li>
            <li>The <strong>push()</strong> method appends a new value you choose to the end of the array. For example: <br> nameOfArray.push('Flower'); It then returns a value which is the length of the array that includes that new value you just pushed.</li>
            <li>The <strong>unshift()</strong> appends a new item to the start of the array. It works similarly to the push() method.</li>
            <li>The <strong>concat()</strong> method is used to merge an array with another array which can be one or more arrays. For example: <br> nameOfArray.concat(['Sun','Garden', 'Rain']); then returns:['Grass', 'Water', 'Dirt', 'Sun', 'Garden', 'Rain']<br> The first 3 water, dirt and sun are from the original array but now the last three are merged in that original array.</li>
            <li>Instead of the concat() method you could use the new <strong>spread operator</strong> which is three dots "..." that are placed in front of the array that can spread out the elements of the array and puts them together which then creates a new array. For example: <br> nameOfArray = [ ...nameOfArray, ...['Sun','Garden', 'Rain'] ]; <br> Returns: ['Grass', 'Water', 'Dirt', 'Sun', 'Garden', 'Rain']</li>
            <li>The <strong>join()</strong> method turns the array into a string and then each item in the array is separated by commas. For example: <br> nameOfArray.join(); then returns: 'Grass, Water, Dirt, Sun, Garden, Rain' <br> You can choose a different separator other than a comma like an ampersand sign as follows: <br> nameOfArray.join(' & '); returns the same as above just instead of commas it is the ampersand sign.</li>
            <li>The <strong>slice()</strong> method creates</li>
            <li>The <strong>reverse()</strong> method is used to reverse the order of an array. For example: <br> nameOfArray.reverse(); then returns the array but in reverse.</li>
            <li>You can also sort the order of an array by using the <strong>sort()</strong> method. For example: <br> nameOfArray.sort(); which sorts the array alphabetically. <br> Numbers also can be sorted alphabetically but by their first digit not numerically where 9 would come after 10.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To define a function literal you would use a <strong>function declaration</strong>. It starts with the <strong>function keyword</strong> then the function name, followed by paraentheses and curly brackets that will contain your code. For example: <br> <i>function</i> functionName() { console.log('Hello World!');}</li>
            <li>Another way you can define a function literal is by creating a <strong>function expression</strong> which assigns an anonymous function to variable. For example: <br> const goodbye = function() {console.log('Goodbye World!');}; <br> You can also create a named function expression as well which would just have the name of the function and then paraentheses after the function keyword.</li>
            <li>The semicolon at the end of the (function expression) finishes the statement but a normal function declaration ends in a block which you don't need semicolons at the end of blocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Function() Constructors</strong> which the body of the function would be entered as a string. For Example: <br> const hello = new Function('console.log("Hello World!");'); <br> Although it is not recommended to declare functions this way.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrow functions (arrow syntax)</strong> is a new way to declare functions which makes declaring functions more concise by using less wordy syntax.</li>
            <li>Arrow functions are identified by the 'arrow' symbol "=>". Parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the function comes after the arrows.</li>
            <li>Arrow functions are always anonymous so in order to refer back to them you have to assign them a variable.</li>
            <li>Example of an arrow function: const add = (x,y) => x + y; <br> If the function doesn't require any parameters a pair of empty parentheses have to still go before the arrow.</li>
            <li>Functions are first-class objects in JavaScript which means they behave the same way as every other object. So functions can also be given be used as a parameter to another function. This is known as a <strong>callback</strong>.</li>
            <li>You can implement a callback by adding a callback as a parameter and then invoking in inside the body of the function.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the better go to loop in most situations: for loop or forEach loop? And Why?</li>
            <li>What is the most common reason to use callbacks?</li>
        </ul>
